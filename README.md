# WebExpress
**WebExpress** is a lightweight, high-performance web server designed to scale seamlessly from resource-constrained environments to larger production systems. Through its extensible plugin framework and comprehensive API, web applications can be developed and integrated quickly using .NET languages such as C#. Some of the key benefits of **WebExpress** are:

- It is easy to use.
- It offers a variety of features and tools that can help you build and manage your website.
- It is fast and efficient and can help you save time and money.
- It is flexible and can be customized to meet your specific requirements.

The **WebExpress** family includes the following projects:

- [WebExpress](https://github.com/webexpress-framework/WebExpress#readme) - The web server for **WebExpress** applications and the documentation.
- [WebExpress.WebCore](https://github.com/webexpress-framework/WebExpress.WebCore#readme) - The core for **WebExpress** applications.
- [WebExpress.WebUI](https://github.com/webexpress-framework/WebExpress.WebUI#readme) - Common templates and controls for **WebExpress** applications.
- [WebExpress.WebIndex](https://github.com/webexpress-framework/WebExpress.WebIndex#readme) - Reverse index for **WebExpress** applications.
- [WebExpress.WebApp](https://github.com/webexpress-framework/WebExpress.WebApp#readme) - Business application template for **WebExpress** applications.

**WebExpress** is part of the **WebExpress** family. The project provides a web server for **WebExpress** applications.

To get started with **WebExpress**, use the following links.

# Tutorial
This tutorial guides you through demonstrating the UI elements of a **WebExpress** application. Learn how to effectively use the templates and controls provided by the `WebExpress.WebUI` project.

## Prerequisites
- Create a `WebExpress` application after the [WebApp](https://github.com/webexpress-framework/WebExpress.Tutorial.WebApp#readme) tutorial but name it `WebExpress.Tutorial.WebUI`.

## Compile and register in WebExpress
- Compile the solution as a release. To do this, open the command line or terminal in the solution directory and run the following command:
  ```bash
  dotnet build --configuration Release
  ```
  This command compiles the solution in release mode. You can find the compiled files in the `bin/Release` directory of your project.

- Run the solution by starting the `WebApp.App` project.
  ```bash
  cd WebApp.App\bin\Release\net9.0
  dotnet run --project ../../../WebApp.App.csproj
  ```

- After compiling, there should be a file with the `.wxp` extension in the `pkg/Release` directory. This file do you need in `WebExpress`.

## Try the application
- Check the result by calling up the following URL in the browser: http://localhost/webui

## Development administrator

For local administration, sign in with the demonstration account `admin` and password `password`. The tutorial's login form and the central authentication endpoint use the same identity provider. The account carries `SystemAccessPolicy` and can open **Settings > System > Certificates**. Invalid credentials are rejected, and the editable characters do not receive administrator rights.

For an existing browser login, sign out and sign in again after updating the tutorial. Previously issued tokens retain their original identity and policies; refreshing the page or renewing the old token does not grant the new administrator policy.

For deployment separation, run this tutorial over **HTTP during development**. Its published credentials are demonstration data and must not be deployed as a production administrator account. Production applications require their own identity provider and credentials, plus **HTTPS**. Configure authentication in the executable host's active settings directory, such as `WebExpress.Develop.App/settings/webexpress.settings.json` when using the combined development host.

Good luck building stunning web applications with **WebExpress**!
